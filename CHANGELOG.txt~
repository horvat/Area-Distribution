%% Version 0.3 - Improved Mechanics

% Smoothing
% -Created file horvsmooth.m which smooths the 2nd to last bins of DA

% Redistribution
% - Removed the Redist_OW_fsd.m file, since it was redundant as of 0.2
% - Created redist_fsd_v2, which instead of presuming each mechanical int.
% ridged into a larger category, actually examines the larger categories
% Finds out which will interact and uses that to judge the new piece size
% Importantly, redefines the participation function to be more of an 
%  overlap function instead of being linearly related to the cdf as it was 
% before

% load_simp_IC
% - Created a whole section dedicated to explaining the shift matrix for 
% the new form of redistribution, which tells what happens when you combine
% two pieces who give up some area in ridging

%% Version 0.2

% Main Driver
% - Added a tolerance so that the program quits when the changes are less 
% whatever the tolerance is

% Plotting
% - Added plotbalance.m, which plots the long-term balance of terms
% - Deleted createfigure.m, put that functionality into plotFSD.m
% - Now output files are in Output/*.fig , *.eps, which show the two plots 
% - Plotting area distribution in loglog instead of semilogy

% Redistribution
% - Changed k in redist_fsd to allow for open water formation
% - Added an artificial control in redistribution to handle A(1) = 0; 
% - Put a multiplier for redistribution inside the redist_f stuff. 

% Swell
% - Added smoothing of output

%% Version 0.1
 
% Redist: 
% - Include formulation for open water created in ridging. NOT USED YET.
% - Open water box does not participate in ridging 
% - Artificial open water creatinon after ridging to account for above
% - Reformulated Participation Function
 
% Melt:
% - Now uses diff instead of loop to compute derivatives
% - Changes in 
 
% load_simp_IC
% - Fixed coefficients for rafting/ridging
% - Changes to Initial Temp T -> -3, thickness stuff, wave period, and othe
% r parameters
 
% load_bc
% - Velocities fixed to be non-divergent
